This is demo code to generate the results in "Robust First and Second-Order Differentiation for Regularized
Optimal Transport" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02015)



*CondH.py*: It plots the delay of the smallest positive eigenvalue $\lambda_{2N-1}$ in $N$ and $\epsilon$ in two cases: (1) Equally spaced points on the unique circle and (2)  Uniformly distributed point cloud in unit square $[0,1]^2$.
